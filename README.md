Improvements:
- Make the code more modular ie completing the process of separating the .py files into folders
- Resolve the issue of why each joke does not have an individual ID - this would make the process of updating, deleting etc
- After moving database_crud.py to the database folder, the connections have broken. Maybe I shouldn't have moved it?
- Clean up the code - I'm sure there are areas I could have made it more concise
- Implement more features to make it more user centric
